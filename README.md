# DoS-Attack-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
This repository contains code for detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It uses an HTTP dataset and various models including ensemble methods, boosting, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and CNN-based architectures. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
